# Inverse Of a SquareRoot

Fast Inverse Square Root Algorithm -- Performance Evaluation

The inverse square root of a floating point number is used in calculating a normalized vector to determine angles of incidence and reflection.
Performance is important here.

This demo compares the perfeormance to calculate an arbitrary vectors of
