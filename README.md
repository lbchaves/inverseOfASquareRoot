# Inverse Of a SquareRoot

Fast Inverse Square Root Algorithm -- Performance Evaluation

The inverse square root of a floating point number is used in calculating a normalized vector to determine angles of incidence and reflection.
Performance is important here.

This demo compares the performance to calculate over an arbitrary vectors of floats.
And the results are intriguing for C++...
